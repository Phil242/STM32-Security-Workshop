# STM32-Security-Workshop
Fix files for the STM32 workshop: "Discover our STM32 security ecosystem, from theory to practice"

Located in folder C:\STM32SecuWS\Tools\teraterm, the two originals files “StartTTPL4.bat” and “StartTTPL5.bat” where not able to detect the comport of the 2 STM32 boards. All non-english Win7 and Win10 should be concerned.       
Working fine on Win7, not tested or reported working (yet) on Win10.               

Auto probe COMPORT, fixed version, works fine on a French windows 7:
* StartTTPL4-V2.bat & StartTTPL5-V2.bat        

Fallback asking you the COMPORT of the board:
* StartTTPL4-MOD.bat & StartTTPL5-MOD.bat
