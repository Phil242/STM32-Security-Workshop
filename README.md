# STM32-Security-Workshop
Fix files for the STM32 workshop: "Discover our STM32 security ecosystem, from theory to practice"

Located in folder C:\STM32SecuWS\Tools\teraterm, the two originals files “StartTTPL4.bat” and “StartTTPL5.bat” where not able to detect the comport of the 2 STM32 boards. 
Provided files here do not try to probe the comport, but ask it to you. Working fine on Win7, not tested or reported working (yet) on Win10.
